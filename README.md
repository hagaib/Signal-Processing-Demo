Signal Processing Demo
=========

This signal processing project is an exercise in signal processing basics and applied spectral analysis in Matlab. 
It was carried out solely for educational purposes. In particular, the filtering implementations are not computationally efficient because they are implemented with Matlab scripting only, with no C/C++ optimization.

The project is divided into the following parts:

Part 1 - signal generation

Part 2 - anti-aliased resampling

Part 3 - spectral analysis

Part 4 - window resolution study (inspired by the seminal paper by Harris)

Part 5 - signal detection in noise

The following were implemented:

Signals with additive components: CW , PMCW and white noise.

Short-time Fourier transform

Anti-aliased resampling

IQ demodulation

IIR Filter design: Butterworth, Chebyshev 1, Chebyshev 2

FIR filter design: windowing method

Filtering implementation: direct 1 & 2 , parallel and cascade forms

Frequency trasformations: lowpass to highpass , lowpass to bandpass

Transfer function z-plane representation

Matlab object oriented programming

I/O using .csv and .mat files
